- **Easing**: Custom cubic-bezier curves for cinematic feel
- **Delay**: Staggered animations for dramatic effect
- **Spring physics**: Natural movement with bounce
- **3D transforms**: Subtle perspective changes

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for base components
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Recharts** for data visualizations
- **CSS-in-JS** for styling

### Animation Components
- **CinematicMetricCard**: Animated dashboard metrics
- **CinematicAchievementCard**: Trophy showcase cards
- **CinematicChartCard**: Animated chart containers
- **CinematicProfileCard**: Profile section cards
- **CinematicSettingsCard**: Settings category cards

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: Components load as needed
- **Animation optimization**: GPU-accelerated transforms
- **Efficient re-renders**: React.memo and useMemo usage
- **Bundle optimization**: Code splitting implemented

## 🎵 Optional Sound Enhancement

A sound effects system has been created (`src/utils/soundEffects.ts`) for a full movie-like experience:

- **Page transitions**: Whoosh sounds
- **Hover effects**: Subtle audio feedback
- **Success actions**: Achievement sounds
- **Ambient tones**: Background atmosphere

To enable sounds:
```typescript
import { useSoundEffects } from '../utils/soundEffects';

const { playPageTransition, setEnabled } = useSoundEffects();
setEnabled(true); // Enable sound effects
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
